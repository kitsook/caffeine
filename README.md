# caffeine

Caffeine is a small utility program that prevents your computer from going to sleep without having to change Windows' settings. It offers configuration options, allowing the user to choose whether to keep the display active. The program aims to stay out of the user's way, and its status can easily be monitoried via the tray icon.
