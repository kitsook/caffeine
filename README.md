# Caffeine

Caffeine is a small utility program that prevents your computer from going to sleep without having to change Windows' settings. It offers configuration options, allowing the user to choose whether to keep the display active. The program aims to stay out of the user's way, and its status can easily be monitoried via the tray icon.

## Downloads

Caffeine has been tested and confirmed to work on Windows XP (x86), 7 (x64), and 10 (x64), but it should work on any version of Windows XP or later, 32 or 64 bit. It will not work on versions of Windows before XP due to those versions of Windows lacking an API used to keep the system active.
